I began looking for pictures of dogs to inspire me
- I then made a simple HTML outline with a header and footer that can be used throughout the website
- I made the header and footer responsive with media queries and a bit of JS
- I made the home page very simple with h1 describing what the webpage is for (dog adpotion)
- I used media queries and flexbox to make the home page repsonsive
- On the adopt page I used Grid to create a responsive layout with the help of media queries as well
- I used clamp() for various text throughout the pages
- on the adopt page we start off with the title in the first row and the pictures in a row of their own with four coloumns
- as the screen gets smaller there are less and less coloumns
- I made the adpotion dog cards interactive so they zoom a bit when you hover over them for a more interactive feel
- I did WAVE and lighthouse tests on all the pages and everything came back very accessibile
- I also added some extra meta tags for better SEO
- I also made two branches working-branch and main
